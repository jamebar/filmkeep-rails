		<comment>I'm a bit embarrassed to admit this as a cinephile, but I have a really hard time with black and white movies. I was bored out of my mind with The Artist, and I started Nebraska and couldn't finish. The weird thing is that I don't think I primarily watch movies for the visuals, I'm actually really big into story and dialogue. I don't know why my brain equates black and white with boring, but it just does. Any B&amp;W recommendations to change my mind? Should I go back to Nebraska?</comment>

		<comment>**For those unfamiliar with filmkeep, this section is blacked out because it contains a spoiler. Do not continue reading unless you have seen the movie** My rating this higher than Maze Runner is probably a result of several things. One, I had to watch Oblivion in two sittings (at a hotel, fell asleep from exhaustion the first time), and two, I think this is a result of pre-conceived notions. I thought Maze Runner was going to be so bad, so it probably got a bump from exceeding my expectations. Third item, having seen &quot;Moon,&quot; my thought from the start was that he was a clone. That being said, I did find it refreshing and really enjoyed it. In a second viewing (and reflecting), I'd probably put this above Maze Runner.</comment>

		<comment>No, but some of my most respected filmmakers and film critics love horror, so I am trying to refine my pallet and see what I am missing. You may remember that I watched Hostel in Austin, and was absolutely disgusted by it. That put me off of horror for a few years, but then I went back and watched Alien and The Shining, and realized scary movies can be great. I really liked Let the Right One In, and enjoyed Drag me to Hell. Now I'm trying to get a better sense of what I like and what I don't. Maybe one day I'll work up the courage to watch Arachnaphobia again, which traumatized me as a kid.</comment>

		<comment>I have to divide horror films into 2 categories.  There's the Texas Chainsaw Massacres which include movies like The Ring, The Grudge, etc.  I don't like those at all.   But then there are Horror movies like The Shining, Alien, Let the Right One In, The Devil's Backbone, even the Exorcist.  I really like those.  I think the difference is the latter are great dramas that happen to also have very scary elements.  Where the former are movies that exist solely to jump scare, disgust you.</comment>

		<comment>I think that this and Nine are the only Daniel Day Lewis films I haven't seen. Let me know what you think. If you haven't seen My Left Foot yet, I highly recommend it. As the father of a child with a muscle disorder, I was blown away by how DDL captured the physicality of it. Similar to Eddie Redmayne in The Theory of Everything, and it won him an Oscar as well.</comment>

		<comment>Interesting, I hadn't made the connection between this and John Wick.  What struck me about the Equalizer is that it was a super hero film without really saying it was.  It followed the Superhero formula to a tee, even having him save other people in small sub plots outside of his main storyllne.  Anyway, I thought it was cool, but yeah, I liked John Wick more</comment>

		<comment>Even though I enjoyed Equalizer, it felt flat to me. I really like you drawing the comparison between the two, because I think they provide a nice contrast in execution of two very similar stories. I agree with what you already stated Wick does better, one of the main things I think Wick does better is getting the audience invested in the character (this is an extension of a longer discussion James and I had). Wick has a great injustice done to him, which I think anyone connects better with. The Equalizer is just a do good er, which everybody likes, but has a harder time connecting with. The great injustice was done to do the girl, and she wasn't as central of a character as I thought she would be. Also, I loved the conflict of the antagonist in Wick. What was he supposed to do?</comment>

		<comment>It's actually amazing how you'll root for a character more due to his dog being killed than if a relative of his was killed.  This solidifies the debate of whether dogs or cats are better.  If his cat were killed would we have cared ?  :)</comment>

		<comment>Buscemi's AMA comments on this film he wrote and directed: &quot;certainly the character that i wrote for myself in TREES LOUNGE would be an exaggerated version of myself. The idea for that film came to me when I thought what would I be doing if I never left my hometown? If I never went into acting? If I never pursued the things that I did? and was still doing the things in my home town that i was doing when I was young, what might I have become?
So I guess you could say there's a lot of me in that character, as well.&quot;</comment>

This is where I get hung up with most of my stories. I spend too much time on the idea/concept and not enough on the actual story.</comment>

In no particular order: Moon, Source Code, Primer, District 9, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Gattaca, Her, Safety Not Guaranteed (maybe), About Time, Under our Skin (maybe)</comment>

		<comment>I was in the same boat you were a couple of months ago. I had watched Howl's Moving Castle a few years ago. It was visually amazing, very imaginative, but there was something that just felt off to me about the story. Something too childish? Then a couple of months ago, I figured I would watch all of them with my kids when they became available at the library. We started with Porco Rosso. The kids absolutely loved it, which really enhanced it for me. I soon realized that most Miyazaki's films don't have a traditional villain, which is why the story didn't carry as easily for me. They are more about the themes, setting, and in a very imaginative world (that are pretty awesome). He does a really good job of creating strong/independent girls, which I wanted to rub off on my kids. Anyway, as we watch each one, they have really grown on me, and now I absolutely love em. Spirited Away is definitely his best. Just not sure if you should grow a taste for it first, or if that will immediately incite the flavor.</comment>

		<comment>I'm going to toss out your &quot;indie&quot; qualifier, to see what else I'd add to the list if there were no restrictions. Here are the few that are missing: Children of Men; Contact; Wall-E; Alien; 2001; The Matrix, Edge of Tomorrow; Terminator 1 and 2; The Thing; Jurassic Park, Star Wars, Interstellar. I would remove Safety Not Guaranteed, Source Code, Primer and About Time. I would say that Ex Machina is easily a top 7 sci fi movie in the last 15 years. That list would include Eternal Sunshine, Moon, Children of Men, Ex Machina, Her, Wall-E, Interstellar.</comment>

		<comment>ha, yeah, it might be a little high.  I enjoy most movies so when I rate one right after seeing it sometimes I'm a little too kind.  I think your assessment is off, mostly because the white guy doesn't really save anyone hence the title.  But I just really like samurai movies and I really like Tom Cruise, so I was bound to like this.</comment>

		<comment>I should have made it clear that I saw this a loooong time ago, before I really became interested in film as an artistic medium, so I was actually serious when I was asking how off my memory was. Clearly I was not remembering very well, because I was thinking Tom played the &quot;last samurai&quot;. I also think that he is eminently watchable, so I should probably re-view this before criticizing. On a side note, what other good samurai films are there?</comment>

		<comment>13 Assassins, and Twilight Samurai are 2 I've seen recently that I really liked.  (13 Assassins is pretty intense).  I've seen 7 Samurai but didn't enjoy it as much, but it's an extremely influential film, many movies since are basically remakes of it (Magnificent 7, A Bug's Life, Three Amigos to name a few).</comment>

		<comment>I did a very rare thing, and stopped Blackhat halfway in because I was so bored. I may have been in the wrong kind of mood for this film, because I was expecting some silly action, and instead got a lot of brooding. I somehow forgot that this was directed by Michael Mann, and thought it was a Ridley Scott film. Does anyone recommend starting it again? Is it worth it?</comment>

		<comment>I liked this one, saw it when it first came out and remember really enjoying it.  The premise is definitely absurd, but I found it intriguing and liked that I couldn't predict what they were going to encounter in each train car.</comment>

		<comment>I'm wondering if I just haven't developed any sensibility for Asian filmmaking. There have been a number of critically acclaimed films and directors from South Korea, Japana and China in the past 10 years that I have tried to enjoy but haven't. It's such a different narrative tradition, with unfamiliar stock characters, unrelatable humor, and a different visual style.</comment>

		<comment>If you haven't given the south korean film industry a chance, checkout these ones that I thoroughly enjoyed:

-'Castaway on the Moon'  (man stranded on island with city in view, comedy/drama)
-'The Man from Nowhere' (great action movie)
-'War of the Arrows'  (robin hood awesomeness)
-'Memories of Murder' (very similar the David Finchers &quot;The Zodiac&quot;)
-'Mother' (Drama, mystery)</comment>

		<comment>Ghost Protocol was beautifully shot (those dubai scenes were amazing). To me though, the story was so bad, it ruined everything. I'd rank Ghost pretty far behind MI:1 and MI: 3. I had a huge list of complaints about the story, but it's been so long, I might have to re-watch so I can relist them.</comment>

		<comment>I meant to acknowledge that I know Brad Bird didn't write Ghost Protocol, but I had hoped being the director, he would have had some say over story. Knowing he was more involved with Tomorrowland, and was one of the writers, I allowed myself to get really excited for this (for heaven's sake, this is the man that created Iron Giant and The Incredibles - some of my favorite stories/writing). I might be a little too hard on these movies because my expectations were so high, but man, Tomorrowland had terrible writing, terrible acting, and terrible characters.</comment>

		<comment>Such ludicrous artisty, I loved it. Practical effects with complementary CGI win. A chase movie from start to finish. Tarantino and Gibson eat your heart out. Dialgoue didn't matter, the flame throwing guitar player won me over. If you didn't think of Brigham Young in this desert, polygamous dystopia, then you and I have been reading different history.  Bravo, George Miller.</comment>

		<comment>Ok, I went and saw it again.  It was actually better the second time around.  I saw the film twice with two different people.  Person number two was able to enjoy the film while person one just laughed and belittled the film the whole time.  I guess the company your with can alter your perception of the film.  

Still doesn't touch the first one of course; better actors, better writing, and the timing was perfect - nobody ever saw CGI like that before.  Plus Newman was in it (nominated for Best Supporting Actor by some esoteric award academy).</comment>

		<comment>@Renni, I might have been caught up in the emotional moment when writing that review, because I very much agree that The Incredibles is the best animation movie. It's actually in my top 5 movies of all time. Inside Out was really good, but it doesn't hold the rewatchability factor nearly as well as The Incredibles.</comment>
